To build a truly "hands-on-keys" analytical engine, the command set must cover layout orchestration, data transformation, and temporal navigation.Following the grammar /command source action [destination], here is the core command library for your system.1. Layout & Workspace ManagementThese commands control the dynamic grid and the "Shelf" (archive).CommandUsageDescription/grid/grid [1-9]Sets the number of visible panes. Scaling is automatic./show/show P12 [to P1]Brings an archived pane into focus. If destination is omitted, replaces current./hide/hide [P1]Moves a pane to the Shelf. Frees up a slot in the grid./swap/swap P1 P2Exchanges the positions of two panes./ls/ls [query]Opens the Visual Gallery overlay to browse archived panes./focus/focus P3Makes P3 the active pane and scrolls to it.2. Data Ingestion & ExtractionCommands for getting data into the system and moving it between formats.CommandUsageDescription/load/load [filename] [to P1]Ingests a PDF, CSV, or Image. Marks pane as Sticky./fetch/fetch [url] [to P1]Grabs content from a web source./export/export P1 [pdf|csv|json]Downloads the content of a pane in the specified format./clip/clip P1 [range]Extracts a specific snippet (e.g., rows 1-10 or a paragraph) to a new pane.3. Transformation & AI AnalysisThe core analytical engine. Note that if destination is omitted, the content is replaced (versioned).CommandUsageDescription/ask/ask P1 "prompt" [> P2]General AI query using the source pane as context./sum/sum P1 "briefly" [> P2]Summarizes source content./plot/plot P1 "bar chart" [> P2]Generates a visualization from data./run/run P1 "python logic"Executes code against the data in P1./tab/tab P1 "extract tables"Scrapes structured data from a document or text./diff/diff P1,P2 [> P3]Performs a comparative analysis between two sources.4. Temporal & Lineage NavigationCommands to move through the version stack and trace data origins.CommandUsageDescription/undo/undo [P1]Reverts the last transformation in the pane./redo/redo [P1]Steps forward in the version history./log/log [P1]Displays a vertical timeline of versions for that pane./source/source [P1]The Lineage Jump. Automatically finds and shows the parent of P1./trace/trace [P1]Toggles visual arrows showing the flow from original anchor to P1.5. Utility & System ToolsManaging the persistent header elements (Clocks/Timers) and the session.CommandUsageDescription/clock/clock [city] [add|rm]Configures the 6 world clocks in the header./timer/timer [time] [label]Sets one of the 5 available countdown timers./save/save [name]Persists the entire workspace (panes, shelf, and lineage)./open/open [session_name]Loads a previous workspace./help/help [command]Displays documentation for a specific command.6. Power-User FlagsUsers can append flags to modify command behavior:-f (Force): Overwrites a Sticky pane without confirmation.-n (New): Forces the output to a new pane even if an in-place replacement was implied.-s (Silent): Executes the command without updating the visual focus.Interaction Example:User: /load internal_audit.pdf > P1  (P1 is now a sticky PDF)User: /tab P1 "Find the spending table" > P2 (P2 becomes a data table)User: /plot P2 "Compare budget vs actual" > P3 (P3 is a bar chart)User: /grid 1 (P3 scales to full screen for inspection)User: /ask "Why is the variance so high in Q3?" (Implicitly uses P3; replaces P3 with text explanation)User: /undo (P3 reverts back to the bar chart)
